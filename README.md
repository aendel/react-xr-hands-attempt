# react-xr-hands-attempt
Brutaly stolen from [this](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-xr-hands-physics-demo-tp97r) codepen which has been made by [react-xr](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-xr)
## How to deal with it
I have been testing this code with an Oculus Quest 2

### Disclamer:
This `README.md` is meant to keep track of what I have done with it
## What I would have been love to knew before:

- The codepen itself was missing any .gitignore file, which was a bit annoying *node_modules* you know.
- The codepen has been written in typescript, but still no typescript in the package.json dependencies.
- In order to make the xr api works properly you need to serve your application through **https**, what i have been found useful it's the following `web.dev` articole: https://web.dev/how-to-use-local-https/
